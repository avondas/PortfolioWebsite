    <p> Through the years I have worked on several projects, ones from school and ones for myself simply to learn more</p>
    <div>
        <h6>School project for Blis Digital</h6>
        <p>
            For one of our last school projects, we had a Product Owner from an actual company with an actual problem.
            Our class was tasked to find the best mechanics to create a mobile declaration app. We had to figure out the best
            OCR module to read off the information, a database to save the information to and the best framework to create
            this app in.<br>
            After doing the necessary research and tests of how well the best frameworks, databases and OCR module's 
            (according to our research) would work together we ended up with the combination of Kotlin and Firebase, 
            which has a build in OCR module and database.<br>
            My part in this project was to create the Login screen and its functionality as well as the logout functionality.
            This project was more about the documentation and research aspect of the life as a Software Developer, so most 
            of our time was spend writing everything we did out. I helped with documenting and executing all the research, 
            tests, testing of the app and the technical report.<br>

            has written about this project and why they did this. <br>

@*   <h6>Dice Roller</h6> *@
@*   <p> *@
@*       I am building a video game with some friends for fun, of which the dice roller is a part of. I created the dice  *@
@*       models in Blender then imported them into Unity. Here I added the functionality to roll the dice and show the result.  *@
@*       I also created the texture of the board the dice fall onto.<br> *@
